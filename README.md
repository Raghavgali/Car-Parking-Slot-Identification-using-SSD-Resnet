# Car-Parking-Slot-Identification-using-SSD-Resnet
Simplify parking management with my Car Parking Slot Identification project. Using SSD ResNet via TensorFlow Object Detection API, it efficiently detects and labels parking slots, making it an ideal beginner project for understanding computer vision in real-world applications.
